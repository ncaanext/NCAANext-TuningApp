**NCAA Next Tuning App Companion for NCAA Next 26 Mod**

This is a companion app for the NCAA Next 26+ Mod that is able to tweak specific aspects of the game further.

**Instructions:**
1. Load either the NCAA Next game ISO or the SLUS_212.14 file in the App. If you use the SLUS_212.14, you will need to recreate a new ISO to play with the tweaks. If you load the ISO directly, it will automatically update the ISO w/o recreating a new ISO!
2. Make tweaks.
3. Save and play!

It is recommended to make a backup before you start tweaking in case you don't like the results!
