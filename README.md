**NCAA Next Tuning App Companion for NCAA Next 26 Mod**

This is a companion app for the NCAA Next 26+ Mod that is able to tweak specific aspects of the game further.

**Instructions:**
1. Load either the NCAA Next game ISO or the SLUS_212.14 file in the App. If you use the SLUS_212.14, you will need to recreate a new ISO to play with the tweaks. If you load the ISO directly, it will automatically update the ISO w/o recreating a new ISO!
2. Make tweaks.
3. Save and play!

It is recommended to make a backup before you start tweaking in case you don't like the results!

**Current Available Tweaks:**


*Dynasty Start Year*
* This is pretty self-explantory. This lets users update the first year in a dynasty.


*Sim Game Length Factor*
* This tweak updates the amount of offensive plays per game. The original game default is 120 plays per game, while the NEXT26 and real-life college stat are roughly 136 plays per game on average. User can adjust this according to their in-game play length settings. Increasing the value will reduce the number of plays per simulated game.


*Number of Conf Champs Automatic Playoff Spots*
* This increases or decreases the number of conference champions that make the playoffs automatically.


*Fatigue Slider*
* This updates the level of fatigue that occurs in gameplay. The higher the number, the more fatigue the players will experience on a play.


*Speed Nerf*
* This enables the "Speed Nerf" mod. This reduces the speed of players in-game but does not affect their ratings. 

*User Team Highlighted Text Color*
* This changes the color of the User Team when shown in various Dynasty Mode screens

*Match-Up Highlighted Text Color*
* This changes the color of the Match-Up pop-up that is available when previewing games in the schedule. This will highlight the team with the better stats or ratings.
